I am a full stack junior software developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy.

I studied biology and after graduation I joined our agricultural family business as a coordinator. After moving to London, I have decided to learn bioinformatics and this is how I came across my first programming language, Python. I soon realised that I am more interested in coding. Before I joined Makers, I had been self studying for a year, using online resources.

I am looking for a role that enables me to contribute to the stages of the software development life cycle and to continue my journey of learning more.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Time frame | Technologies | Testing/Other
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 [Power of Truth Server](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/PowerOfTruthServer) and [Power of Truth Mobile App](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/PowerOfTruth) | Makers final project. Working as an Agile team, we created a mobile news application that lists headlines from various sources across the political spectrum and displays their political bias. The client retrieves information via our API that is deployed on [Heroku](https://power-of-truth-server.herokuapp.com/headlines). | 10 days | React Native, Node.js, Expo, Google News API | Jest, CircleCI
[Acebook](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/acebook-d-railed) | A team project aimed to build a Facebook clone, using Agile principles and Ruby on Rails, deployed on [Heroku](https://acebook-d-railed.herokuapp.com/). | 10 days | Ruby on Rails, Active Record, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop, Travis CI
[Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/bowling-challenge) | A weekend challenge aimed to build a web application that allows the user to record their scores during a bowling game. | 4 days | JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap | Jasmine
[MakersBnB](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/MakersAirBnB-) | My first project as a member of an agile team, with the aim to build an AirBnB clone. | 5 days | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, DataMapper, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Capybara
[Chitter](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/chitter-challenge) | A weekend challenge aimed to build a Twitter clone. | 2 days | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Capybara, Rubocop
[Takeaway challenge](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/takeaway-challenge) | A weekend challenge as part of the Makers Academy programme on week 2. The program represents a takeaway restaurant that takes orders and sends confirmation messages to the customers' phones. | 2 days | Ruby, Twilio API | RSpec

## Skills

#### Independent learner

I have been learning how to code since 2018 using various online resources (W3Schools, tutorialspoint, etc.). After learning the basics of Ruby, I have taken up challenges on RubyMonk, [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/EdinaBMakers/stats) and [Exercism](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/exercism-ruby-track). I was coming from a non-IT background and I have been able to adapt to the new challenges and concepts that comes with software development. [My Repositories](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers?tab=repositories) reflect the progress I made in a short period of time, covering a number of technologies, libraries and processes (e.g. TDD).

Makers taught me how to learn new technologies and concepts every week. [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/bowling-challenge) is a web application I wrote after only 5 days of learning JavaScript.

#### Teamwork and Communication

During the Makers course I was either pairing or working on team projects. Pairing was an effective way of knowledge sharing, discussing ideas and getting people up to speed, while features were split into smaller user stories and their implementation was parallelized. One of our team projects is [Acebook](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/acebook-d-railed), a Facebook clone, that we implemented and delivered as an Agile team. We first identified the user stories and prioritised them, so that we could deliver the most viable product first. We used a digital Trello board to track progress and lead time, and had frequent stand-ups to discuss the potential blockers and the remaining work. To ensure the best code quality, as a team, we agreed to work on separate feature branches and always review each other's changes before completing pull requests. [Our Acebook Wiki](https://github.com/marbuthnott/acebook-d-railed/wiki) is a detailed diary of our team work during these two weeks.

#### Ownership

For our final project at Makers, our team have decided to create the [Power of Truth Mobile App](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/PowerOfTruth), that displays the political bias of articles from various external sources across the political spectrum.

As external sources and news providers may change from time to time, I have suggested creating [Power of Truth Server](https://github.com/EdinaBMakers/PowerOfTruthServer), our own news API, to translate between internal and external domains, hide connectivity details and pre-calculate data. As a result, the mobile application remained thin and independent of our 3rd party news sources.

After the API got the green light from the team, I took ownership of the design, implementation, testing and deployment of the interface. To keep the team up-to-date, I have frequently created pull requests and involved them in code reviews.

#### Pragmatism and Time Management

During the Makers course we have frequently realised that the given time frame was not enough to implement 100% of the user stories or features. In those situations I aim to deliver the minimum viable product first.

#### Consistency

Throughout my projects I consistently apply naming conventions, coding style and best practices. It results in easy-to-read and recognisable code within and across my repositories.

#### Patience

Patience is a skill that helps me in many situations when it comes to software development. It makes me a better partner for pair-programming, helps with learning new technologies, finding solutions online, debugging code and performing better under pressure.
